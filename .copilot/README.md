# Project Task Management System

## Overview

This directory contains structured task definitions for the todo.app.be project. Each task follows a standardized format optimized for VS Code Copilot integration.

## Structure

- `/epics/` - High-level project objectives (weeks/months)
- `/stories/` - User-focused features (days/weeks)
- `/tasks/` - Specific implementation steps (hours/days)
- `/templates/` - Reusable templates for consistency

## Naming Convention

- **Epics**: `epic-{number}-{short-name}.md` (e.g., `epic-001-task-management.md`)
- **Stories**: `story-{number}-{short-name}.md` (e.g., `story-001-project-setup.md`)
- **Tasks**: `task-{number}-{short-name}.md` (e.g., `task-001-nestjs-setup.md`)

## Status Tracking

Each file includes frontmatter with status, assignee, and metadata for easy filtering and project management.
